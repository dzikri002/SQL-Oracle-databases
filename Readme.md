# SQL-Oracle-databases

More than *40 exercises* on Basic Queries, Advanced queries, Storaged Procedures (PL) and Triggers on SQL for Oracle Database.

This repository was created for the course "Databases" that was taken place during October 2015 - January 2016 in Madrid.

The repository is divided into 3 main folders.
- Basic_intro: given a relational model I had to implement on SQL (creating the tables, constraints and the rest of the relational stuff).
- SQL_Queries: contains more than 30 queries. From basic ones to more complex.
- Triggers_Procedures: some exercises on storaged procedures and triggers (functions that get executed when some condition is done like insert, delete, update...).
